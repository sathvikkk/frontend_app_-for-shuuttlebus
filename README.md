1. Create a simple html page frontend web app to add the passenger details.

This application is for creating a front end application for adding the passenger details  to database.

I have used the HTML and python flask for creating with database connection.

For Html file  --  I have added in the template folder.
    add.html -- used the form tag to add the passsenger details.

For python file -- I have used the flask framework.
    app.py -- added the mysql config details  in this file

For database connection --  I have used flask mysql.

packages need to install:

sudo apt install python3-pip

        pip install flask
        pip install flask-mysql 
        <!-- pip install flask_mysqldb -->
 
 Run the Application using --- python3 app.py
